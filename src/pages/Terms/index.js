      <h3>6. USER CONTENT</h3>
      <p>
        The Site includes interactive areas or services (“Interactive Areas”) in which you or other users may create, post, send or store
        ads, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, video, graphics, applications, code, links or other items
        or content on the Site (“User Content”). By using the Site, you agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or
        otherwise publish or send through the Site any of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        a. User Content that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing, threatening,
        abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent, false, misleading or otherwise objectionable;
        <br />
        b. User Content that would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party or
        that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law;
        <br />
        c. User Content that may impinge upon the publicity, privacy or data protection rights of others, including pictures or information
        about another individual where you have not obtained such individual’s consent;
        <br />
        d. User Content that may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any
        party. By posting any User Content, you represent and warrant that you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such User
        Content;
        <br />
        e. User Content that impersonates any person or entity or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity;
        <br />
        f. Viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files; or
        <br />
        g. User Content that, in the sole judgment of Conflux, is objectionable or which restricts or inhibits any other person from using
        or enjoying the Interactive Areas, the Site, or which may expose Conflux, Conflux Protocol, or its users to any harm or liability of
        any type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conflux does not control, take responsibility for or assume liability for any User Content posted, stored or uploaded by you or any
        third party, or for any loss or damage thereto, nor is Conflux liable for any user conduct or any mistakes, defamation, slander,
        libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or profanity you may encounter. When you participate in Interactive Areas, you
        understand that certain information and content you choose to post may be displayed publicly or to select users. You are solely
        responsible for your use of the Site and the Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you become aware of User Content that you believe violates these Terms, you may report it by emailing terms@confluxnetwork.org.
        Enforcement of the Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement of these Terms in some instances does
        not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances. In addition, these Terms do not create any private
        right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation or promise that the Site will not contain any content
        that is prohibited by the Terms. Although Conflux has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the User Content posted on the
        Site, Conflux reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen or edit any User Content posted or stored on the
        Site at any time and for any reason without notice, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies and replacing any User
        Content you post or store on the Site at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Site in violation of these Terms may result in,
        among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except as otherwise provided herein, on the Site or in a separate agreement, Conflux claims no ownership or control over any User
        Content. However, if you post User Content to the Site, you grant Conflux a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and
        fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform
        and display such User Content on our websites and on third-party sites. This license will terminate when you remove your User
        Content, except that the license will continue with respect to any offsite uses that have already been made and any cached or
        archived uses that may still exist when User Content is removed. By posting User Content, you hereby release Conflux and its agents
        and employees from any claims that such use, as authorized above, violates any of your rights and you understand that you will not
        be entitled to any additional compensation for any use of your User Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        By posting User Content to the Site, you represent and warrant that: (a) such User Content is non-confidential; (b) you own and
        control all of the rights to the User Content or you otherwise have the right to post and use such User Content and to grant the
        rights to Conflux that you grant in these Terms; (c) the User Content is accurate and not misleading or harmful in any manner; and
        (d) the User Content, and your use and posting thereof in connection with this Site, does not, and will not, violate these Terms or

    <section>
      <h3>17. ARBITRATION</h3>
      <p>
        PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH CONFLUX AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN
        WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. You and Conflux agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Site, except
        that you and Conflux are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged
        unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT
        OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Conflux agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it
        arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration. In any arbitration, the parties will not seek
        discovery from each other, and the arbitrator shall not allow parties to engage in discovery; rather, each party shall disclose the
        evidence supporting their positions at some mutually agreeable time and date prior to the final hearing. Other than className
        procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in
        court. Neither you nor we will participate in a className action or className-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these
        Terms. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated
        claims involving another person, if Conflux is a party to the proceeding. If the prohibition against className actions and other
        claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above are found to be unenforceable, then that language shall be deemed to have
        been dropped from the Terms and the remaining obligations relating to arbitration shall continue in full force and effect.
